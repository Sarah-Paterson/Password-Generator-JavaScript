## Description

In this project, I worked with existing code provided by Xandromus and The Coding Bootcamp on GitHub. I was motivated to refactor the existing code to create a more user friendly website that allows better universal accessibility through semantic elements and descriptions with images.

This website was created for the Horiseon team to share knowledge on Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. I refactored this website to optimize the user friendliness, update links, and add more organization to the code.

Through the process of refactoring this webpage, I was able to learn more about accessibility through semantic elements and how they can be used for the visually impaired. The alt elements for the images also help with visually impaired accessibility. I also learned that the semantic elements and text descriptions can also help with search engine optimization.

## Code Modification

The key to this project was to refactor the code without changing the website display. To illustrate some of the modifications I made, I created this section to share a few examples. Below is a comparison between the header in the starting code and the header in my refactored code.
    
Starting HTML Code - **Header**

Starting CSS Code - **Header**

## Usage

The final website for Horiseon is a simple landing page that presents information. The navigation bar at the top of the page provides quick access to the information displayed further down on the same page.

Though the way the webpage is viewed has not changed from refactoring the code, the top links work correctly, and the code is more organized.
